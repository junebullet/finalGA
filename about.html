            DJ Junebullet is an innovator. She has captured a balance that few dual DJ/promoters attain: adding to the aesthetic and making a positive difference in the community. Known to her friends as simply Maegan Wood, DJ Junebullet helped form the First Ladies DJ Collective in 2002 - an all-female crew dedicated to promoting and empowering female DJ's in the nation's capital and beyond. Since then, she has gone on to perform at clubs, parties, festivals, and events from New York to Berlin.

            Today, DJ Junebullet is an active member of the DC queer scene. She is best known for the well-loved parties HottBoxx, She Rex, and today - alongside Anthology of Booty - the yearly Booty Rex Queer Pride Party. As a member of Coup Sauvage and the Snips, she created danceable beats and shared the stage with renowned acts including The Make-Up, Mykki Blanco, and JD Samson.

            In addition, she is a co-founder of the Girls Rock! DC music camp and has brought innovative DJ workshops and classes to individuals, groups, and community spaces. These workshops have appeared at Girls Rock! DC, Artisphere, and local clubs including the Black Cat, Dodge City, and DC9.
            She is sure to not only keep you moving, but also make you thankful, on so many levels, that she's a HUGE part of the DC nightlife community.
